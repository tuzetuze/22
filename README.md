# GPT Implementation Project

This project aims to implement the GPT principle using the transformer architecture. The GPT model is a type of large language model developed by OpenAI, known for its generative capabilities.

## Project Structure

- `src/transformer_architecture.py`: Contains the implementation of the transformer architecture.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project.

## Usage

To run the project, navigate to the `src` directory and execute the `transformer_architecture.py` file.

## Dependencies

- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Torchtext

## Future Work

- Pre-training the model on a large dataset.
- Fine-tuning the model for specific tasks.
